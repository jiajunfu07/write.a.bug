## Creating a workspace
When you make progress and start to work on several applications, the best practice is to name each workspace with the name of the application or robot. \
For example, if you create a workspace for a robot named `ABC V3`, then you can name it `abc_v3_ws`\
Open a terminal, navigate to the home directory, and create the workspace.
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir ros2_ws
```
Then, enter the workspace and create a new directory named `src`
```
$ cd ros2_ws/
$ mkdir src
```
### Building the workspace
Navigate to the workspace root directory, and run `colcon build` command. `colcon` is the build system in ROS2. It was installed by installing the `ros-dev-tools` packages.
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build
Summary: 0 packages finished [0.73s]
```
Currently, no packages were built, but we can see three new directories
```
$ ls
build   install   log   src
```
* `build`: the directory will contain the intermediate files required for the overall build.
* `log`: the logs for each build.
* `install`: all the nodes will be installed after building the workspace

If you make a mistake and run `colcon build` from another directory (let's say, from the `src` directory of the workspace, or inside a package), simply remove the new `install`, `build`, and `log` directories that were created in the wrong place. Then go back to the workspace root directory and build again.\
If you navigate inside the newly created `install` directory you can see a `setup.bash` file. **Every time you build your workspace, you have to source it.**

```
$ source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
We can add it into `.bashrc` as below, so we don't need to source it everytime we open a new terminal.
```
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

## Create a package
Any node you create will exist within a package. Hence, to create a node, you first have to create a package (inside your workspace). The architecutre of a Python package is quite different from a C++ package.
### Python package
1. `ros2 pkg create <pkg_name>`: This is the minimum you need to write.
2. You can specify a build type with `--build_type <build_type>`. For a Python package, we need to use ament_python
3. You can also specify some optional dependencies with `--dependencies <list_of_dependencies_separated_with_spaces>`. It's always possible to add dependencies later in the package.
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/
$ ros2 pkg create my_py_pkg --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy
```
```
/home/<user>/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg
├── my_py_pkg
|   └── __init__.py
├── package.xml
├── source
|   └── my_py_pkg
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── test
    ├── test_copyright.py
    ├── test_flake8.py
    └── test_pep257.py
```
* `my_py_pkg`: Another directory with the same name. This directory already contains an `__init__.py` file. This is where we will create our Python nodes.
* `package.xml`: Every ROS 2 package must contain this file. We will use it to provide more information about the packages as well as dependencies.
* `setup.py`: This is where you will write the instructions to build and install your Python nodes.

### C++ package
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/
$ ros2 pkg create my_cpp_pkg --build-type ament_cmake --dependencies rclcpp
```
```
/home/<user>/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
|   └── my_cpp_pkg
├── package.xml
└── src
```
* `CMakeLists.txt`: This will be used to provide instructions on how to compile your C++ nodes, create libraries, and so on.
* `include` directory: In a C++ project, you may split your code into implementation files(.cpp extension) and header files(.hpp extension). This directory is used for the header files.
* `package.xml`: The same functionality as the one in python package.
* `src` directory: This is where you will write your C++ nodes (.cpp files).

### Building a package
To build the packages, go back to the root of your ROS 2 workspace and run `colcon build`. \
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build
Starting >>> my_cpp_pkg
Starting >>> my_py_pkg
Finished <<< my_py_pkg [1.60s]
Finished <<< my_cpp_pkg [3.46s]
Summary: 2 packages finished [3.72s]
```
The important thing to notice is the line: `Finished <<< <package name> [time]`. This means that the package was correctly built. \
After you build any package, you also have to source your workspace so that the environment is aware of the new changes. \
To build only a specific package, you can use the `--packages-select` option, followed by the name of the package.
```
$ colcon build --packages-select my_py_pkg
```

## Create a Python node
To create a node:
1. Create a file for the node.
2. Write the node.
3. Build the package in which the node exist.
4. Run the node to test it.
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg/my_py_pkg/
$ touch my_first_node.py
$ chmod +x my_first_node.py
```
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyCustomNode(Node):
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__('my_node_name')
       self.counter_ = 0
       self.timer_ = self.create_timer(1.0, self.print_hello)

   def print_hello(self):
       self.get_logger().info("Hello " + str(self.counter_))
       self.counter_ += 1

def main(args=None):
   rclpy.init(args=args)
   node = MyCustomNode()
   rclpy.spin(node)
   rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
```
We first import `rclpy`, the Python library for ROS 2. Inside this library, we can get the `Node` class.
```
class MyCustomNode(Node):
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__('my_node_name')
```
We then create a new class that inherits from the rclpy Node class. In this class, make sure you call the parent constructor with `super()`. This is also where you will specify the node name.
```
def main(args=None):
   rclpy.init(args=args)
   node = MyCustomNode()
   rclpy.spin(node)
   rclpy.shutdown()
```
In the `main()` function, we perform:
1. Initialize ROS 2 communication with `rclpy.init()`.
2. Create an object from the `MyCustomNode` class we wrote before.
3. Make the node spin with `rclpy.spin()`.
4. After the node is killed, shut down ROS 2 communications with `rclpy.shutdown()`.

To create the timer, we use the `create_timer()` method from the `Node` class. We need to provide two arguments: the rate at which we want to call the function (float number in seconds), and the callback function. Note that the callback function should be specified without any parentheses.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```
The last one is a pure Python thing and has nothing to do with ROS2. It just means that if you run the Python script directly, the `main()` fuction will be called. \
As the `MyCustomNode` class inherits from the `Node` class, we get access to all the ROS 2 functionalities for nodes. For example, we get the `get_logger()` method from Node, and with the `info()` method, we can print a log with info level.

### Build the node
We can test the code just by running it in the terminal(`$ python3 my_first_node.py`). However, what we want to do is actually install the file in our workspace, so we can start the node with ros2 run, and later on, from a launch file. \
We usually use the word "build", because to install a Python node, we have to run `colcon build`.
To build(install) the node, we need to do one more thing in the package. Open the `setup.py` file from the `my_py_pkg` package. Locate `entry_points` and `'console_scripts'` at the end of the file. For each node we want to build, we have to add one line inside the `'console_scripts'` array:
```
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            "test_node = my_py_pkg.my_first_node:main"
        ],
    },
```
Here is the syntax
```
<executable_name> = <package_name>.<file_name>:<function_name>
```
* First, choose an executable name. This will be the name you use with `ros2 run <pkg_name> <executable_name>`
* For the filename, skip the `.py` extension.
* The function name is `main`, as we have created a `main()` function in the code.
* If you want to add another executable for another node, don't forget to add a comma between each executable and place one executable per line.
* Node name, filename, executable name sometimes could be the same.
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colon build --packages-select my_py_pkg
```
On top of --packages-select <pkg name>, you can add the --symlink-install option, so you won't have to build the package every time you modify your Python nodes; for example, `$ colcon build --packages-select my_py_pkg --symlink-install`. This only works for Python packages.

## Creating a C++ node
We first include `rclcpp`, the C++ library for ROS 2. This library contains the `rclcpp::Node` class.

We create a class that inherits from the `Node` class. From this `Node` class, we will be able to access all the ROS 2 functionalities: logger, timer, and so on. As you can see, we also specify the node name in the constructor.

```cpp
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

class MyCustomNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
   MyCustomNode() : Node("my_node_name"), counter_(0)
   {
       timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(std::chrono::seconds(1),
                                        std::bind(&MyCustomNode::print_hello, this));
   }

   void print_hello()
   {
       RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Hello %d", counter_);
       counter_++;
   }

private:
   int counter_;
   rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
   auto node = std::make_shared<MyCustomNode>();
   rclcpp::spin(node);
   rclcpp::shutdown();
   return 0;
}
```
In the `main()` function, we do exactly the same thing as for Python:
1. Initialize ROS 2 communications with `rclcpp::init()`
2. Create a node object from your newly written class. As you don't create an object directly, but a shared pointer to that object, you have to use `std::make_shared<>()` function. In ROS 2 and C++, almost everything you create will be a smart pointer (shared, unique, and so on).
3. Make the node spin with `rclcpp::spin()`
4. After the node is killed, shut down ROS 2 communications with `rclcpp::shutdown()`

As you can see, once again, the node is not the program itself. The node is just an object that we create in the `main()` function. This is a very important concept to understand when you start working with ROS 2 and C++. You can have multiple nodes in the same program, and you can also have multiple programs running at the same time, each with its own nodes.

**Timer creation:**

For the timer, we have to create a class attribute: `rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;`

We use the `create_wall_timer()` method to create a timer. The first argument is the interval at which we want to call the callback function (as a chrono duration), and the second argument is the callback function itself. We use `std::bind()` to bind the callback function to the class method.
### Building and running the node
To build the C++ node, we need to add some lines to the `CMakeLists.txt` file of the package. First, we need to find the required packages with `find_package()`. Then, we need to add an executable for our node with `add_executable()`, and link it with the required libraries with `ament_target_dependencies()`.
```
# find dependencies
... ...
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
```
```
add_executable(test_node src/my_first_node.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(test_node rclcpp)

install(TARGETS
  test_node
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```
To build a C++ node, we need to do three things in the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
1. Add a new executable with `add_executable()`. Here, you have to choose a name for the executable (the one that will be used with `ros2 run <pkg_name> <executable_name>`), and provide the path to the source file.
2. Link the executable with the required libraries with `ament_target_dependencies()`. Here, you have to provide the executable name and the list of libraries.
3. Finally, install the executable with the `install()` function. so that we can find it when we use `ros2 run`. Here, you have to provide the executable name and the destination path. The destination path should always be `lib/${PROJECT_NAME}`.
```
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build --packages-select my_cpp_pkg
```
After building the package, don't forget to source the workspace again.
```
$ source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
Now, you can run the node with `ros2 run <pkg_name> <executable_name>`
```
$ ros2 run my_cpp_pkg test_node
[INFO] [my_node_name]: Hello 0
[INFO] [my_node_name]: Hello 1
[INFO] [my_node_name]: Hello 2
...
```

## Node template for Python and C++ nodes
**Python Node Template:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyCustomNode(Node):  # MODIFY NAME
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('node_name')  # MODIFY NAME
        # Your code here

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = MyCustomNode()  # MODIFY NAME
    rclpy.spin(node)
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**C++ Node Template:**

```cpp
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

class MyCustomNode : public rclcpp::Node  // MODIFY NAME
{
public:
    MyCustomNode() : Node("node_name")  // MODIFY NAME
    {
        // Your code here
    }

private:
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    auto node = std::make_shared<MyCustomNode>();  // MODIFY NAME
    rclcpp::spin(node);
    rclcpp::shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```
## Introspection
### ros2 node command line
Lists all the currently running nodes
```
$ ros2 node list
/my_node_name
```
Provides information about a specific node, including its publishers, subscribers, services, and parameters.
```
$ ros2 node info /my_node_name
/my_node_name
  Subscribers:
  Publishers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /rosout: rcl_interfaces/msg/Log
  Services:
    /my_node_name/get_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters
    /my_node_name/get_parameter_types: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes
    /my_node_name/list_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters
    /my_node_name/set_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters
    /my_node_name/set_parameters_atomically: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically
  Service Clients:
  Actions Servers:
  Actions Clients:
```
### Changing the node name at runtime
To add any additional arguments when you run a node, you can use the `--ros-args` flag. \
To rename the node, add `-r __node:=<new_node_name>` when you run the node. `-r` means remap. you could also use `--remap` instead of `-r`.
```
$ ros2 run my_py_pkg my_first_node.py --ros-args -r __node:=new_node_name
```
When running multiple nodes, you should make sure that each node has a unique name. Having two nodes with the same name can lead to unexpected issues.

## Summary
1. Create and set up a ROS 2 workspace.
2. In the workspace, you can create several packages (Python or C++) that represent sub-parts of your application.
3. Create a file inside the package directory.
4. Write the node code (using the templates above).
5. Set the build instructions in `setup.py` for Python nodes or `CMakeLists.txt` for C++ nodes.
6. Build the package from the workspace root directory.
